			<p>I am a front-end web developer with experience in creative design and editing.  I attended the front-end web development bootcamp at <a href="http://www.grandcircus.co">Grand Circus Detroit</a>, an intensive 8-week course that focused on learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I earned my bachelors degree in public relations from Western Michigan University where I graduated cum laude.</p>
			<p>My interest in coding started at a young age, watching my uncle program our family's computer.  That lead to dabbling in coding in high school with my own web page.  While I attended college for communications, and later worked as an administrative assistant at a non-profit organization, my interest in coding and passion for creating reemerged.  I look forward to putting my new skills to work!</p>
			<p>When not busy coding and designing, I enjoy spending time at home with my husband in Farmington Hills.  I also enjoy traveling, playing pub trivia, attending aerial arts classes, and playing French horn in the Farmington Community Band.</p>
